# Loan Fallout Prediction using Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression

- **Goal:** Compare performances of multiple machine learning models in predicting binary loan fallout classification problem, given borrowers' personal information being features
- **Project Breakdown:**
  - *First Part (Section 2-4):* Load data, check data quality, and preprocess data (missing value imputation, data transformation, feature engineering, etc.) based on our discretion
  - *Second Part (Section 5):* Conduct train-test split of data; train, cross-validate, and test three machine learning models (Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression); Evaluate performance based on metrics like precision, recall, f1 score, AUC, etc.
- **Project Conclusion:** With models being optimized through cross-validation process, all of the 3 models are showing similar overall prediction power, but SVM costs significantly more time than other two models to train and predict.
- **Data:** Hypothetical loan application with individuals' information for almost 60000 records
